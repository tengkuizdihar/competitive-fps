# Changelog
Here be all the changes to the released version of the game.

## Version 0.0.1
The first ever tagged release of my in-development game! The game itself is in a very early state, sorry for the bugs! In the game development, this would be considered pre-alpha of the project.

### Warning
There is no sound/music available for this build except for the gun shot, knife swooshing, and the ding when you hit a target.

### Basic Character Manipulation:
1. Move with the infamous "WASD" keys.
2. Jump using the spacebar.
3. Crouch using the ctrl key.
4. Swap your weapon with the "Q" key.
5. Switch weapons with the numbers key
  * Key "1" for primary weapon (which is unavailable because I haven't implemented it yet)
  * Key "2" for secondary weapon
  * Key "3" for melee weapon
6. Drop your weapon using "G", will not work for knife.
7. Pick up your dropped weapon by getting close enough to it and press E.
8. Use your weapon (shoot the gun or swing the knife) using the left key.

### How to play the game.
1. Shoot the available target and observe that counter go up!
2. Shoot the reset button to reset the scoreboard.

I hope you like it!
