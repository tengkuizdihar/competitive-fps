# Competitive FPS Project

A personal project about the perfect tactical first person shooter. While right now there's no implementation to speak of, right now you can at the very least look at the living document that's the proposal for this game. The documents can be explored in the folder `documents/`. Everything shall be written in plain text or open source format like ODT used by libreoffice.
